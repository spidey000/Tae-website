# Product Guidelines

## Visual Identity
- **Style:** Cyberpunk aesthetic. High contrast, neon accents, dark backgrounds.
- **Goal:** Differentiate from standard sterile financial tools while maintaining readability.

## Tone of Voice
- **Primary Tone:** Helpful, simple, and educational.
- **Approach:** Avoid jargon where possible; explain complex terms clearly when they must be used. Focus on empowering the user.

## User Interaction
- **Input:** Real-time calculation updates. As the user adjusts inputs, the results should reflect the changes immediately without needing a page reload or a "Calculate" button.
- **Views:** Toggleable views for data presentation (e.g., toggling between simple summary and detailed breakdown).

## Data Visualization
- **Primary:** Line graphs to show amortization and equity growth over time.
- **Secondary:** Detailed amortization tables for granular data inspection.

## Branding
- **Logo:** Use existing 'tae-website' assets.

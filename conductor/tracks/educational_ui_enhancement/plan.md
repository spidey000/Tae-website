## Phase 2: Educational Content
- [ ] Create/Update `EducationalSection.jsx` (or a new `ExplanationCard.jsx`) with the provided text about TIN/TAE.
- [ ] Ensure it is responsive and matches the visual style.

## Phase 3: Integration
- [ ] Add tooltips to all inputs in `App.jsx` (Capital, Years, TIN, etc.).
- [ ] Add tooltips to `ResultsSummary` items where appropriate.
- [ ] Add tooltips to `InitialExpenses` and `LinkedProducts`.

## Phase 4: Verification
- [ ] Verify mobile responsiveness of tooltips and the new card.
- [ ] Check text legibility and theme consistency.
